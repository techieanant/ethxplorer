# Ethereum Block Explorer

Ethereum block explorer made with React, Github Pages and MetaMask

Demo: COMING SOON

You can change the network in metamask, and the explorer will update. This is useful when you need to test multiple testnets or private nets. 
Currently uses Infura endpoint instead of Metamask.
